# DeepLeague - by Farza  

Yo whats up boys n girls my name's **Farza**.  To read more about how I actually built this thing you can read the blog post here. And be sure to follow me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/farzatv?lang=en). I'm semi-lit. Also, very sorry if the code is ugly! I wrote most of it in two days.

### So what is it?

DeepLeague is the first program of its kinds that combines computer vision, deep learning, and League of Legends in order to move LoL analytics to the next level by giving developers easy access to te data in the *pixels* of the game. It also offers a dataset of over 400,000 minimap images *labeled* with bounding boxes/ classes. Let me explain!

Riot API only allows people to get *post-game data*, things like kills, deaths, items purchased, etc. In terms of analytics, theres only so much you can do with this boring data. But what if you could get *live*  data during the game while a game is actually happening? Imagine if you called an API and got back information about stuff actually happening during that live game, things like: positions of the champions at specific timestamps, location of wards, status of towers, what items people are buying, when a champion is dead, etc. That'd be super cool! But, Riot simply does not allow it for obvious security reasons. 

BUT, this is all data you can get by actually watching the game, right? But, we don't want to watch thounsands of hours of League of Legends! And this is where DeepLeague comes in. 

DeepLeague allows users to input a League of Legends VOD and will predict the location of all the champions in the game at every frame by **"watching"** the minimap. It does this by running the VOD through a deep convolutional neural net that I trained (on a dataset I gathered) which specializes in predicitng bounding boxes + classes.

### Cool, what can I do with it?
The possibilties with DeepLeague are endless and I really want people to create cool stuff based off it! 

Here's a couple things you could do given the output from DeepLeague.

- analyze how the jungler paths, where he starts his route, when he ganks, when he backs, which lane he exerts the most pressure on, when mid roams, which lanes mid ganks when it roams
- analyze when laners overextend, when laners die, when they are getting pressured by other lanes, when they are losing lane, when they die, when they leave laning phase
- analyze when teams set up dives, when they decide to do dragon, how they rotate around the map as a team, how they set up baron

I go through the installation process step by step under Installation, so don't worry you won't need a Ph.D in AI to get this running! :)





  - Type some Markdown on the left
  - See HTML in the right
  - Magic

# New Features!

  - Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
  - Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)


You can also:
  - Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
  - Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable

> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [Breakdance](http://breakdance.io) - HTML to Markdown converter
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md] [PlDb] |
| Github | [plugins/github/README.md] [PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md] [PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md] [PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md] [PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md] [PlGa] |


### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantanously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma test
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud

See [KUBERNETES.md](https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger/blob/master/KUBERNETES.md)
